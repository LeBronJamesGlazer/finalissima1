// Interface for the Builder design pattern.
// Defines the step-by-step construction process of a complex object â€” in this case, a ProductMeal.
// Specifies methods for building main dish, drink, and dessert, as well as retrieving the completed meal.
// Concrete classes (e.g., BurgerMealBuilder, PizzaMealBuilder) implement this interface
// to provide specific meal-building logic.
